# pytorch_ensemble

This project uses the ensemble approach proposed in:

Goel, T., Haftka, R. T., Shyy, W., & Queipo, N. V. (2007). Ensemble of surrogates. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 33(3), 199-216.

to use a set of pytorch neural networks to act as an ensemble of surrogate functions for approximating response surfaces.
